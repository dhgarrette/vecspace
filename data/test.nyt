WITNESS SAYS O.J. SIMPSON BOUGHT KNIFE WEEKS BEFORE SLAYINGS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES  (BC-SIMPSON-KILLINGS-1stLd-3Takes-Writethru-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the nation's attention riveted again on a Los
Angeles courtroom, a knife dealer testified that O.J. Simpson
bought a 15-inch knife five weeks before the slashing deaths of his
ex-wife and her friend.

This is a special 
paragraph.
</P>
<P>
The German-made Stilleto knife Simpson purchased May 3 had a
6-inch stainless steel blade and a handle made of deer antlers with
brass trim, said Allen Wattenberg, owner of Ross Cutlery in
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Simpson asked that the knife be sharpened and Wattenberg
complied, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wattenberg was the first witness to testify Thursday in a
hearing to determine if prosecutors have sufficient evidence to
bring the former National Football League great to trial for murder
in the June 12 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure -- and new details about evidence in the case --
was among several surprises in a hearing broadcast on television
live. The preliminary hearing in the downtown Criminal Courts
Building continues today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, prosecutor Marcia Clark and Simpson's
attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, sparred on evidence, and agreed to
proceed next Tuesday on a defense motion that complains that
evidence pulled from Simpson's estate was illegally obtained.
</P>
<P>
A motion filed Wednesday by the defense contends that a
detective who scaled the wall of Simpson's estate June 13 violated
Simpson's privacy, compromising a subsequent search and tainting
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Jailed without bail since June 17 in the slayings of his ex-wife
and her friend, Simpson appeared in court Thursday looking more
comfortable and rested than he has at any of his four prior court
appearances. He wore a navy blue suit, white shirt and a burgandy
tie with white polka dots.
</P>
<P>
As he was escorted into the courtroom, Simpson smiled and put an
arm around his attorney.
</P>
<P>
The families of both victims monitored proceedings from the
courtroom. Members of the Brown family wore an angel pin that was a
replica of one frequently worn by Nicole Brown Simpson.
</P>
<P>
Farther down on the same bench, Ronald Goldman's father, Fred,
and stepmother, Patti, sat grim-faced, often gripping each other's
hands or shoulders for support.
</P>
<P>
Three witnesses testified before the hearing was recessed at
4:30 p.m., including the co-owner and a store clerk at Ross
Cutlery, where Simpson was said to have purchased a knife while
filming a TV pilot outside.
</P>
<P>
``I guess he was attracted to the knife,'' store clerk, Jose
Camacho, said in testimony after Wattenberg. ``It's a nice-looking
knife. And he just -- he just liked it.''
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Camacho was made more striking when he conceded
he was paid $12,500 by the tabloid The National Enquirer for his
story about selling the folding knife.
</P>
<P>
Wattenberg testified that the payment would be split between
Camacho, him and his brother, Richard Wattenberg, a co-owner of the
story.
</P>
<P>
Asked by Shapiro whether he had been told by prosecutors not to
talk to anybody about the Simpson case, Camacho -- who testified
before the Los Angeles County grand jury -- replied that he had been
given conflicting orders.
</P>
<P>
He explained that while prosecutors had told him not to talk,
``this lady, Patti -- she works for the district attorney -- said
that we could if we wanted to.
</P>
<P>
``She told us that people talk to the press,'' Camacho said.
</P>
<P>
``Are you a little uncertain about this, Mr. Camacho?'' asked
Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman.
</P>
<P>
``Yes,'' the witness replied.
</P>
<P>
The grand jury hearing evidence in the case against Simpson was
disbanded last week by a judge who said he believed that some
jurors had been tainted by pre-trial publicity in the case.
</P>
<P>
Camacho said he was under a lot of pressure to talk when the
media descended on the store days after the killings.
</P>
<P>
``I was lying because I was told to lie,'' he said. When he
learned the Enquirer was paying someone else money for less
information than he had, Camacho said he decided to talk.
</P>
<P>
``I wanted to stop lying,'' he said, adding that he found the
media to be ``tricky people.'' Camacho also testified that the
television tabloid, ``Hard Copy,'' had offered to pay him for his
story, but it was only ``some peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
Camacho testified that he sold Simpson the knife for $74.98,
which Simpson paid for with a $100 bill, although the store kept no
written record of the sale.
</P>
<P>
He also said Simpson asked to have the knife's 6-inch blade
sharpened.
</P>
<P>
A third witness Thursday, John DeBello, general manager of
Mezzaluna, testified that Nicole Simpson dined at his restaurant in
the Brentwood area of Los Angeles that night with friends and
family.
</P>
<P>
``She frequented the restaurant quite often,'' DeBello said.

NIGERIA TRIUMPHS OVER GREECE, 2-0
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FOXBORO, Mass.  (BC-SOC-WCUP-GREECE-NIGERIA-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Super Eagles of Nigeria made a triumphant
landing in their first trip to the World Cup. Their 2-0 triumph
over Greece here on Thursday night, combined with Argentina's 2-0
loss to Bulgaria, gave Nigeria first place in Group D.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria will play Italy here on Tuesday, Bulgaria will play
Mexico at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., also on Tuesday,
and Argentina will travel to Los Angeles to play Romania on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Greeks go home as the last-place team in the tournament. In
their first appearance in the World Cup, they allowed 10 goals and
were the only team not to score.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria got its goals from Finidi George, in the last minute
before halftime, and Daniel Amokachi, on injury time at the end of
the game.
</P>
<P>
Emanuel Amunike started the play that led to George's goal by
slipping the ball to him from the left side. George took a few
strides down the middle of the field and chipped the ball over the
head of goalkeeper Christos Karkamanis from the top of the penalty
area.
</P>
<P>
Amokachi's goal came on a blistering 25-yard shot to the upper
right corner that that guaranteed Nigeria first place on the group.
</P>
<P>
``We were in constant communication with Dallas and we knew we
needed a second goal,'' said Clemens Westerhof, the coach of
Nigeria. ``We wanted to stay here and play Italy. We didn't want to
travel.''
</P>
<P>
Westerhof, 54, is a Dutchman who is in his second stint as coach
of Nigeria. He has spent five years in Nigeria as the coach of the
national team. He said African nations had made tremendous progress
and that a country from that continent would someday soon become a
World Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was eliminated by Cameroon for a berth in the 1990 World
Cup and Cameroon then became the darling of the tournament with its
upset victory over Argentina on opening day.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria appears to have advanced further than Cameroon at this
stage. The Super Eagles captured the African Nations Cup in March
and captured their group in their first World Cup.
</P>
<P>
``This was a good experience for us,'' said Coach Alkis
Panagoulias, who probably coached his last game for Greece. ``we
learned a lot from this.''
</P>
<P>
Panagoulias criticized the players for being ``amateurs'' after
the 4-0 loss to Argentina in their opening game, but the biggest
humiliation for the Greeks was the 4-0 loss to neighboring Bulgaria
in Chicago last Sunday.

<P>
He testified that Nicole Simpson Brown's party left around 8:30
p.m. -- about one or one and a half hours before Goldman ended his
shift and left the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
``I was speaking with him behind the bar that evening. That was
the last time I spoke to him,'' DeBello said.
</P>
<P>
He also testified that he saw one of his employees, Karen
Crawford, retrieve a pair of prescription eyeglasses off the
sidewalk outside the restaurant, near the valet's stand. The
glasses were put in an envelope, DeBello said.
</P>
<P>
A coroner's report indicated that an envelope containing a pair
of eyeglasses was found near the feet of Goldman's body. Witnesses
told police he had gone to Nicole Simpson Brown's home to drop off
the glasses left at the restaurant by her mother.
</P>
<P>
DeBello's testimony helped prosecutors better fix the time of
the slayings.
</P>
<P>
Officials put the time of Nicole Simpson's death after 11 p.m.
because Simpson and her mother, Judi Brown, had talked by phone at
that hour. But Louise Brown put the time of the call at closer to
10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of both Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found at
12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Simpson's lawyers have said the former National Football League
great was at home at the time of the slaying, awaiting a ride to
the airport to catch a 11:45 p.m. flight to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro left the courthouse Thursday without speaking to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
In a brief news conference Thursday, Deputy District Attorney
William Hodgman reminded reporters that the prosecution must only
show a ``strong suspicion'' that Simpson is guilty to have him
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
``Wait until all the pieces of the puzzle are presented,''
Hodgman urged.
</P>
<P>
Clark, meanwhile, identified Patti Jo Fairbanks as the district
attorney's office employee who spoke with grand jury witnesses
about the secrecy of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
``She urged them not to speak to the press,'' Clark said. ``We
can't police people.''
</P>
<P>
Most witnesses spoke to police before speaking to the media,
Clark noted, adding that it was ``human nature'' for some to yield
to the prospect of being paid for their information.
</P>
<P>
``That's a problem that's going to pervade every publicity
case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
In other developments Thursday, documents previously sealed by
the court revealed that police saw blood on the driver's door
handle of Simpson's Ford Bronco parked outside the house.
</P>
<P>
``Blood droplets were subsequently observed leading from the
vehicle on the street to the front door of the residence,'' Los
Angeles Police Department Detective Philip Vannatter stated in a
search warrant affidavit.
</P>
<P>
The document also confirmed that police recovered a man's
leather glove ``containing human blood'' on the south side of
Simpson's home. ``This glove closely resembled a brown leather
glove located at the crime scene at the feet'' of Goldman.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, the judge ordered that prosecutors may take from
40 to 100 hairs from Simpson's head in order to compare them with
hairs found on two hats -- a blue knit cap seized at the crime scene
and a plaid cap found on the floor of Simpson's Ford Bronco.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro had sought an order that just one hair could be taken
from Simpson, saying ``100 hairs is unduly invasive.''
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors called a Los Angeles Police Department
criminalist to testify that more hairs are needed to make a
microscopic comparison.
</P>
<P>
Michele Kestler, assistant director of the LAPD's crime lab,
testified during an evidentiary hearing whether various blood
samples recovered by police were sufficient to be shared with the
defense for independent testing.
</P>
<P>
``Some appear to be available for a split,'' Kestler said,
adding, however, that she would only know for sure once the LAPD
had completed its battery of tests.

RED SOX TOP YANKEES, 6-5
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BOSTON  (BC-BBA-YANKS-REDSOX-NYT)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Terry Mulholland trudged through six innings and
made every Yankees advantage seem precarious, Buck Showalter
thought it would be wise to remove him and ask his bullpen to
protect a two-run lead. Showalter's request was denied.
</P>
<P>
The Boston pinch-hitter Damon Berryhill rocketed a two-run
triple off Bob Wickman to erase the deficit in the bottom of the
eighth inning. Berryhill then took a huge lead and scored on Lee
Tinsley's slow groundout to first base to vault the Red Sox to a
6-5 victory over New York on Thursday night at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
Since Wickman failed to protect the edge, this proved to be a
game when lengthy streaks died. The Red Sox were elated to snap a
12-game losing streak at home, their longest in 68 years. The Yanks
were deflated as their eight-game winning streak fizzled.
</P>
<P>
New York left two runners on base in the ninth after Ken Ryan
whiffed Jim Leyritz and retired Danny Tartabull on a flyout to the
warning track in right field.
</P>
<P>
Instead of zipping through six games undefeated on this trip,
which would have been a first for the Yankees since 1976, and
instead of sweeping a four-game series at Fenway for the first time
since 1986, New York was left with one blemish. But the blemish
spotlighted the Yankees' weakness: the bullpen blew a save for the
ninth time and failed to record a save for the second straight
night. (The Yankees rebounded for a 4-3 victory in 10 innings
Wednesday after Steve Howe botched the save.)
</P>
<P>
After Wickman retired Andre Dawson on a popout to second with
two on in the seventh, he stumbled in the eighth. Trailing by 5-3,
the Red Sox created drama against New York's relievers when Otis
Nixon began the inning by walking and stealing second. Following
Wes Chamberlain's groundout, Wade Boggs failed to handle Scott
Cooper's routine grounder to third and was charged with an error.
Cooper is the third baseman who replaced Boggs, so the ornery
Fenway fans were thrilled with the miscue and the burgeoning rally.
</P>
<P>
Berryhill provided the fans with more excitement by drilling a
shot over Bernie Williams's head in center field for a 400-foot
triple that tied the score at 5-5. Berryhill's triple was
important, but so were his quick feet. With the Yankees playing
their infield in, Berryhill had a terrific jump when Tinsley tapped
to Mike Stanley at first. Berryhill scored the decisive run without
a throw.
</P>
<P>
It was a relief to Boston Manager Butch Hobson, who twice
dispatched his pitching coach, Mike Roarke, to make a change while
he was being booed so incessantly.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox began bumbling immediately. Williams walked to open
the game and Luis Polonia singled him to third. Rich Rowland was
then charged with a passed ball on a pitch that glanced off his
glove and dribbled about 20 feet behind the plate. Williams breezed
home and, when Rowland's throw bounced past pitcher Joe Hesketh for
an error, Polonia took third base. Leyritz's groundout made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
After Chamberlain's run-scoring single off Mulholland, a former
Phillies teammate, in the second, the Yankees surged ahead, 4-1, in
the third on Dave Silvestri's sacrifice fly and Gerald Williams's
single. Mulholland avoided serious damage in the fourth when he
walked the bases loaded with two outs before being rescued by
Velarde's superb backhanded play at third and his long throw on
Rowland's grounder.
</P>
<P>
No one saved Mulholland in the fifth when Mo Vaughn belted a
two-run homer to right field that trimmed the deficit to 4-3. Of
the last 20 homers the Red Sox have hit against the Yankees, Vaughn
has clubbed 9. Before the Yankees grew too anxious, Velarde poked
his third homer in the last six games to open the sixth off Hesketh
and raise Mulholland's edge to two runs. It did not last and the
Yankees exited Boston frustrated.

WORLD'S BEST FLOCK TO MANHATTAN BEACH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES  (BC-GEN-BEACHVOLLEY-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This holiday weekend the sands of Manhattan Beach
will be shuffling with the top professional beach volleyball
players in the world.
</P>
<P>
More than 140 players will be competing for a total purse of
$100,000 in the Manhattan Beach Open, which begins today and runs
through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Times for the three-day event are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today, 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Considered by players and fans as the ``Wimbledon'' of pro beach
volleyball, the Manhattan Beach Open will include new faces, old
faces and the world's top-ranked players.
</P>
<P>
One face that won't be seen this weekend is that of Karch
Kiraly, former Olympian and the No.1-ranked player on the Miller
Lite/AVP Pro Beach Volleyball Tour. Kiraly is recuperating from a
kidney bruise suffered three weeks ago at a tournament in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Kiraly's teammate, Kent Steffes, instead will be joined by Scott
Ayakatubby. Despite the absence of Kiraly, Steffes and Ayakatubby
enter the tournament as the top seed.
</P>
<P>
There are several other well-known professionals participating.
Rounding out the top three seeds behind Steffes and Ayakatubby are
second-seeded Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh and third-seeded Adam
Johnson and Randy Stoklos.
</P>
<P>
Former Cal State Northridge star Matt Unger also will be
competing, pairing with Rob Heidger. They enter the tournament as
the 23rd seed.
</P>
<P>
One of the older faces known to most volleyball fans is that of
Sinjin Smith, who will be making his comeback in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
Smith, the winningest player in pro beach volleyball history,
has not played on the tour since the end of the 1993 season and is
returning following arthroscopic knee surgery in late December and
February.
</P>
<P>
Smith will be paired with Mark Eller, who is a 16-year veteran
of the tour. The two enter the tournament as the 17th seed.
</P>
<P>
As for new faces, the Manhattan Beach Open remains the only stop
on the AVP's 26-city tour where anybody can sign up to play. This
year's event will consist of 64 men's teams (16 qualifying teams)
and eight women's teams.
</P>
<P>
Competition will be held on 13 courts next to the Manhattan
Beach pier and, for the first time, three 27-inch color monitors
will be placed at three different locations for the fans.
</P>
<P>
NBC Sports will be televise the event beginning Saturday at 10
a.m. and continuing on Sunday with the final at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Several booths and tents of more than 17 sponsorships will also
be lining the beach, with contests and giveaways going on all
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tickets for courtside seating can be purchased at the event.
Grandstand seating is free.

Shapiro then began a tedious cross-examination, questioning
Kestler about a long list of evidentiary items that were seized.
</P>
<P>
Clark interrupted. ``This is going to take all day in the manner
in which counsel is proceeding,'' she complained to the judge.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro snapped back: ``Your honor, with all due respect, I am
representing a man who is charged with two counts of first-degree
murder and may be facing the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
Clark suggested that Shapiro could speak off-the-record with the
witness and get ``more information.''
</P>
<P>
``I'm trying to assist counsel and be more efficient and more
effective,'' she offered.
</P>
<P>
``We certainly appreciate that,'' Shapiro said, a touch of
sarcasm in his voice. ``If we don't have any further suggestions as
to how we should present our case, we should be able to finish
this.''
</P>
<P>
The judge interrupted the exchange, as she was forced to do
several times during the day-long hearing.
</P>
<P>
At one point, Clark complained: ``Counsel has no right to
dictate to the prosecution the manner in which the investigation
will proceed.''
</P>
<P>
Later, when Clark attempted to open a sealed envelope containing
evidence on-the-record, Shapiro objected: ``It seems like a little
bit of grandstanding.''
</P>
<P>
``I don't believe Mr. Shapiro would say that,'' Clark fired
back.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the judge opted to order that the defense be present
for all tests ``to safeguard Mr. Simpson's right'' to have equal
access to the evidence and results of scientific testing.
</P>
<P>
Interest in the case was overwhelming and security tight at the
courthouse, where a fleet of satellite trucks beamed the
preliminary hearing across the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the courtroom Thursday with family members and reporters --
and seated in the last row -- were the 10 people who'd lined up
beginning at 12:30 a.m. to get passes to view the celebrity murder
case.

SO FAR, IT'S BEEN ENTERTAINING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
 (BC-SOC-RECAP-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty-six games and one round into the World Cup, the early
conclusion has to be: This thing just might work.
</P>
<P>
With the second round of the tournament, which is now a
single-elimination race to the final in Pasadena on July 17, to
begin on Saturday, the first round has been entertaining. FIFA's
decision to give three points for a win instead of two has produced
more teams playing for wins.
</P>
<P>
Scoring is way up from four years ago (92 goals this year
compared to 82 in '90), the action is better and, coupled with more
yellow cards and the no-backpass rule, there is more end-to-end
action than before. With the notable exception of the opening match
between Germany and Bolivia, most of the games have been fun to
watch.
</P>
<P>
The first round also has served to wipe out some soccer myths.
To wit:
</P>
<P>
-- The insurmountable one-goal lead that wise guys like to talk
about. South Korea scored twice in the final six minutes to tie
Spain and if Bodo Illgner's arms are a few inches shorter, South
Korea comes back from a three-goal deficit to tie Germany.
</P>
<P>
-- People won't actually go to matches. How many sellouts were
there? Sixteen. Even in Dallas, which had the hardest time selling
tickets, the last two games were sellouts.
</P>
<P>
At this point, the American World Cup is averaging 66,654 per
game, and that would make it the best attended finals of all time.
The 1966 World Cup in Brazil owns that distinction now with an
average of 60,772 for 22 games. Of course, the 199,850 fans who
filled massive Maracana Stadium for the championship game helped
that average a bit.
</P>
<P>
The top venue has been the Rose Bowl, with an average of 90,708
per game and three sellouts. Foxboro Stadium in Foxboro, Mass., has
been the most full, averaging 955 people more than its designated
capacity. Soldier Field in Chicago has averaged three more patrons
than capacity.
</P>
<P>
-- Soccer fans will tear apart cities. Still waiting. The only
people to have done anything bad are locals.
</P>
<P>
-- No one will watch on television. Last weekend's games on ABC
got better ratings than Wimbledon and golf and included the
highest-rated soccer match in U.S. history. An estimated 22 million
people watched the U.S. lose to Romania.
</P>

round:

JERRY LAMBERT ISN'T READY TO RIDE INTO RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
INGLEWOOD, Calif.  (BC-RAC-GOLDCUP-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Lambert isn't ready to be anybody's
guest of honor.
</P>
<P>
That's the role Hollywood Park thrust him into Thursday morning
at the post-position draw for the 55th Hollywood Gold Cup, the
classic race Lambert won aboard Native Diver in 1965, 1966 and
1967.
</P>
<P>
But Lambert looked as uncomfortable as a man can look in his
favorite boots, jeans, western shirt and cowboy straw hat.
</P>
<P>
``I never was too much concerned about the glory,'' he said
between drags on a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
Also, as much as he enjoys reminiscing about Native Diver, he's
not about to call it a career. A weathered 53, Lambert is the
oldest active jockey in Southern California, winning Arabian races
at a better-than-25-percent clip at Los Alamitos.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest in a series of comebacks from injuries
ranging from fractures to collapsed lungs to -- in 1982 -- temporary
paralysis in his left arm. The last time Lambert got hurt -- in 1990
when a horse shied from his whip and crashed through the Golden
Gate Fields rail -- doctors told him to give up racing to save his
back.
</P>
<P>
After a year of therapy, and enough electrostimulation ``to
light up a light bulb,'' Lambert rode again.
</P>
<P>
``I think it's just love for the game,'' Gary Brinson, the
Hollywood Park starter who has known Lambert since both were
jockeys in early 1960s, said of his friend's perseverance. ``He's
fit, he rides horses all the time, the only time he's ever backed
off is when he got hurt. That's his life -- being around horses.''
</P>
<P>
Not that the rest of the world hasn't tried to intrude.
</P>
<P>
On the fall, 1963 day when Lambert first rode Native Diver for
trainer Buster Millerick, he showed up at the old Tanforan
racetrack in San Bruno and found a draft notice in his locker.
Native Diver won the race by 12 lengths and set a 1 1/16-mile track
record. But, to keep the mount, Lambert had to arrange weekend
leaves from his Army base in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
``If you applied in advance, you could get two or three days,''
he remembered. ``I burned up a brand-new Cadillac (and) got nine
speeding tickets going from Hollywood Park or Santa Anita to
Monterey. I don't know how I survived those couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
Incentive, no doubt. By 1965, Native Diver, then 5, was the top
handicap horse on the West Coast, a 6-5 favorite when he won the
Gold Cup by five lengths over Babington and a field that included
Hill Rise. In 1966, he was 7-5 when he won by 4} over O'Hara and
became the Gold Cup's first back-to-back winner.
</P>
<P>
He wasn't favored when he went for three in a row in 1967.
Charlie Whittingham-trained Pretense was 3-10 in the five-horse
race.
</P>
<P>
``That one worried me the most,'' Lambert said. ``That horse had
consistently beaten Native Diver.''
</P>
<P>
Native Diver won by five lengths, with Pretense second, in the
race where O'Hara, riderless since stumbling at the start, actually
crossed the finish line first.
</P>
<P>
The three victories were essentially the same -- Native Diver
sprinted to big leads and wasn't threatened. Lambert never used the
whip.
</P>
<P>
The big, black horse and the 5-foot-3 jockey were a perfect
match, really. Native Diver was nervous and didn't respond to the
whip. Lambert was as quiet in the irons as he was around other
people.
</P>
<P>
``Everything was the hands, like (Bill) Shoemaker,'' Brinson
said.
</P>
<P>
Lambert was tough -- the 5-foot-3, 113-pound jockey was arrested
near Santa Anita one night in 1968 for trying to punch a 6-foot-2,
200-pound policeman after a friend was stopped for drunk driving.
And he was a fast thinker -- he once reached out during a race to
push a falling apprentice rider in the saddle.
</P>
<P>
Lambert was in the saddle for most of Native Diver's 34 stakes
victories, which made the gelding the first California-bred to earn
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
The horse's last victory, in the Sept. 5, 1967 Del Mar Handicap,
came just eight days before his death of a ruptured intestine.
</P>
<P>
Only in death was the source of Native Diver's speed and stamina
certified. His heart, weighed as part of an autopsy, was a huge 10
pounds.
</P>
<P>
``That probably got him a little more air than the rest of
'em,'' Lambert said.
</P>
<P>
He was buried under a 20-foot monument in what is now the
Hollywood Park saddling paddock. Lambert took his daughter, Lacey,
9, to see the memorial when he rode at Hollywood Park one day last
month.
</P>
<P>
With 54 stakes wins, Lambert ranks 11th on the Inglewood track's
all-time list. He holds another place in local racing history, as
Convenience's jockey in her 1972 match race victory over Typecast --
and Shoemaker -- at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
But don't bronze Jerry Lambert just yet. It may be a few more
years before the small-town Kansas native retires to a life of
hunting and fishing. For now, he's a jockey.
</P>
<P>
``I like it,'' he explains simply. ``I'll do it till I can't do
an honest job anymore.''
</P>

POLICE INITIALLY SEARCHED WITHOUT WARRANT, SHAPIRO SAYS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES  (BC-SIMPSON-SUPPRESS-2Takes-LADN)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to discredit key evidence before it is
entered in court, O.J. Simpson's defense team has won a hearing
into whether police conducted a warrantless search -- tainting
evidence seized at Simpson's estate.
</P>
<P>
The motion by defense attorney Robert Shapiro claims police
initially inspected Simpson's home without a warrant, and then used
those illegal observations to obtain a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams declined Thursday to
discuss the motion, but said he's convinced the investigation was
``conducted in an outstanding manner.''
</P>
<P>
Arguments on the motion were delayed until Tuesday at the
request of Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark, who did not say
what aspects of the defense motion would be disputed.
</P>
<P>
However, if it is established a search was made without a
warrant, prosecutors would have to provide a justification.
</P>
<P>
Until the hearing scheduled for Tuesday, no testimony can be
presented about the 34 items of evidence seized evidence from
Simpson's home, driveway and Ford Bronco -- including blood samples,
a glove, clothing articles, hair and fibers.
</P>
<P>
Al Menaster, an attorney in the Los Angeles County public
defender's office, said that defense teams rarely prevail on
suppression of evidence motions.
</P>
<P>
``We don't win many of these motions, a microscopic number,''
Menaster said.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, it is a good strategy to introduce a
suppression motion at the preliminary hearing, because it can catch
prosecutors off-guard and lock them into a legal theory, Menaster
said.
</P>
<P>
And, even if the defense loses the motion at the preliminary
hearing, it can move again to set aside the information at the
Superior Court level -- though with some restrictions, Menaster
said.
</P>
<P>
If the defense can convince Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell to
suppress the evidence, ``it would be a major blow to the
prosecution,'' said James S. Bell, a suburban Woodland Hills
attorney who publishes a statewide compendium of search and seizure
cases.
</P>
<P>
``Usually if a search and seizure motion is successful at a
preliminary hearing there is no trial,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
But, he added California case law over the past 15 years shows
judges at the trial level are reluctant to grant motion's
suppressing evidence, and are usually receptive to prosecutors'
arguments that warrantless searches are legal under certain
exceptions to the 4th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
In the Simpson case, the battle over evidence suppression might
be central, because there is no confession and no known eye-witness
to the murders of Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her
friend Ronald Goldman, said Elizabeth Warner-Sterkenburg, a deputy
public defender in the Long Beach Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
``If there is any theory under which you can argue those items
were seized illegally, in the absence of eyewitnesses and a
confession, it could make the whole case go away,''
Warner-Sterkenburg said.
</P>
<P>
Shapiro's motion to ``quash and traverse the search warrant'' is
a broad, eight-point search and seizure argument.
</P>
<P>
Its central assertion is that police climbed the 5-foot wall of
Simpson's home after they failed to reach him by telephone with
news of his ex-wife's death, and did so without sufficient reason
to breach Simpson's privacy.
</P>
<P>
Case law says that police must abide by search and seizure
restraints, even in murder cases, unless there is a compelling
reason -- usually involving the safety of the occupants -- to do
otherwise.
